# Worts-trophy-case

## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with [this script].

After setting up, you can run the application using [Heroku Local]:

    % heroku local

## Deploying

If you have previously run the `./bin/setup` script,
you can deploy to staging and production with:

    % ./bin/deploy staging
    % ./bin/deploy production

## Authentication

Authentication in this app works like this:
- All worts members are stored in the users table
- Sign ups don't happen via the UI - you can only log in if you are already in
  the users table (which means that you're a paying worts member)
- When a non-worts user logs in (with non-worts email address), show message
  "Sorry, this email address doesn't seem to belong to a worts member"
